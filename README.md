# intro_to_neural_network_lab

This lab is part of assignment 1 for CS231N at Stanford.

In this lab you will write numpy code to train a two-layer feed forward neural network 
on the [cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) for an image classification task.

The notebook two_layer_net.pynb is where you will test code written in neural_net.py that computes the 
following:
1. forward pass (including loss)
2. backward pass (including local gradients)
3. Data selection for SGD
4. Label prediction given trained weights

## Setup

Once you have [Python3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/), run the following command to set up the notebook requirements:

'pip install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab'
